= Ansible Role OpenSCAP

This Ansible role may be used to evaluate and remediate systems via
https://www.open-scap.org/[OpenSCAP] security profiles.

= Requirements

No special requirements outside of what Ansible itself brings to the table.
However, a browser is useful to view the generated HTML report files.

= Example Playbook

How would you use this role in a Playbook?

First one should decide what security profile to use on the systems.
https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/choosing-policy/[OpenSCAP - Choosing Policy] may be of
help to you. Once a security profile has been decided upon you may want to tailor it to your needs.
For such a purpose a tailoring file may be used. These are XML files containing adjustments to a
existing profile. Often created using the https://www.open-scap.org/tools/scap-workbench/[SCAP Workbench]
tool. Store such a file in a location on the Ansible Control Node. For example in your playbook
directory, possibly in a `files/openscap` directory at that location.

Essentially, in short:

- Choose a OpenSCAP profile and set it as value for `openscap_profile`
- Optionally: use a tailoring file for adjustment. Set `openscap_tailoring_file` to it's path.

An example playbook:

```
    - hosts: servers
      become: true
      vars:
        openscap_profile: 'xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_server_l1'
        openscap_tailoring_file: 'files/openscap/content/ssg-cis_server_l1_tailored_for_my_company.xml'

      roles:
         - stejoo.ansible-role-openscap
```
